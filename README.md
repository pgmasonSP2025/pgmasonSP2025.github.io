# About Me
 ## Pursuits I am Working towards  
   *I have two projects I am currently working on at home    
   1. First off I am going to have some fun tearing down my old porch. Do not know exactly what I want to do with it  
      but 2 chairs and a grill will be required.  
   2. The other project I am working on is restoring some slightly used inwall speakers to use in my living room. Luckily I have a friend that works in this industry helping me out, we are also re wiring the internet throughout the entire house since we will be in the walls already.    
   *Recipes I want to perfect this year    
   1. The recent snow has inspired me to figure out soup and how to get the perfect snow day meal.  
   2. Beef stroganoff would be my next runner up, I still remember my moms after a long school day and it would always be delicious.  
   3. Some might laugh at this but I also want to perfect the grill cheese. Just something about finding the perfect bread to cheese combo would solve all my problems.  
 ## What I am watching  
   *[Solo Leveling preview on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BIBXA1Tpp8U)  
	- I find this anime interesting because of the way the main character had to earn his achievements and how they are used in his world. It almost breaks the fourth wall in the anime allowing the viewers a spoiler or two.  
   *[American Primeval preview on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U8WMvCrywYg)  
	-This is a great show but it can be a bit violent so keep that in mind. It is set back in 1857 and follows the stories of several people and how some lives had to be lived. What I find really interesting about this show was it was set 50 years after the events in the movie The Revenant. I have not gotten to see any of the characters yet but curious to see what they will bring.
